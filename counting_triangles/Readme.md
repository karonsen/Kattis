# Counting Triangles
In this directory is my solution for the problem [Counting Triangles](https://open.kattis.com/problems/countingtriangles).
The code has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, no guarantees for other operating systems are given.

Tests have been written using the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) test framework.
In order to run the tests Catch2 has to be installed according to the instructions given in the link.

This is currently a work in progress.
