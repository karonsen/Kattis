# Counting Triangles
In this directory is my solution for the problem 'Counting Triangles' which can be found [here](https://open.kattis.com/problems/countingtriangles).
The code has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, no guarantees for other operating systems are given.
Tests have been written using the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) testing framework, which needs to be installed in order to be run.

This is currently a work in progress.
